# ML Engineering Systems

This repository focuses on the engineering side of machine learning systems.
The emphasis is on scalability, reproducibility, deployment, and lifecycle management.

## What This Repo Demonstrates
- Feature store design
- Experiment tracking and model versioning
- Model registries and promotion workflows
- Automated retraining pipelines
- Inference optimization and latency considerations
- Monitoring and failure handling

## Included Projects
- feature-store-and-model-registry-system  
- automated-retraining-pipeline  
- real-time-inference-service  

## Engineering Principles
- Systems over notebooks
- Configuration-driven experiments
- Explicit separation of training and inference
- Production constraints treated as first-class concerns

## How to Navigate
Each project implements a specific part of the ML lifecycle.
Projects can be used independently or composed together.
